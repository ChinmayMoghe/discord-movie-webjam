# discord-movie-webjam

Some movies are meant to stir some emotion among us, some inspire people, while some are mistakes we best forget about. But every movie could benefit from some creative web presence! This WebJam is about just that!  
Create a single page/non-scrollable site for a movie of your choosing. The site should work on any screen size and illustrate the the movie. It can be a recreation of an existing poster.  
Text for the poster cannot be used as the only content for the page however.
Both imaginary and real movies are accepted. Creativity is what's important.  
If you need help with coding or designing, ask the community. Good luck and have fun!

This time around, we are taking a different approach with difficulty, we ask you the participant to self identify, among the following tiers.

Beginner: Anything that meets the basic requirements of the challenge  
Intermediate: Introduce intermediate techniques like moving components, animation, or other advanced JS/CSS techniques.  
Advanced: Top cut, industrial-grade project designed to captivate the person visiting your website. Involves complex animations and/or transitions.

Note: None of the above are hard requirements, that must be present in your project. They are examples of how you might want to classify your submission. All classifications are done by the submitter. Submissions Project Submissions will happen through a Google form. This post will be updated to include the link shortly. Submissions are individual only, no teams.

## üèóÔ∏è Metrics

This is how the community will judge your submission. Voting will happen through a google form that will be forwarded once all submissions are collected. The community should keep in mind the difficulty level of the website they are voting for and make sure those requirements are met. Beyond that each submission will be rated on a scale of 1-10 for each complexity, design and quality. Anyone voting should make sure they check at least 5-10 submissions so you don't vote for the first project you open.
